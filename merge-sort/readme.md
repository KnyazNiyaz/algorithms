Important Characteristics of Merge Sort:
- Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists.
- Merge Sort is a stable sort which means that the same element in an array maintain their original positions with respect to each other.
- Overall time complexity of Merge sort is O(nLogn). It is more efficient as it is in worst case also the runtime is O(nlogn)
- The space complexity of Merge sort is O(n). This means that this algorithm takes a lot of space and may slower down operations for the last data sets.
